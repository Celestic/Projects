AUTOMATIC NUMBERPLATE RECOGNITION CAMERAS
=========================================

-  Maximum amount of cars possible passing a camera
	Busiest motorway M25:	165,000 cars / day  =  6875 cars / hour  =  +- 115 cars / minute


-  Amount of bytes that need to be written per time interval

	Example output:
	===============
	30000000;6850YK89;2014-04-09;00:00:00.0;120  =  43 bytes

	GROOTTE 	        ==>  5.173 bytes / minute  =  303.15 kB / hour
	GROOTTE OP SCHIJF   ==>  8.192 bytes / minute  =  480.00 kB / hour   (because of clusters that couldn't be used to their full potentional)
	
	If all camera's would be as busy:	8000 ANPR Camera's * 480.00kB / hour  =  3.66GB / hour


-  Traffic simulation:

	==> Generating cars with a starting and ending coordinates

		Other properties:
			- License registration plate
			- Speed
			- Type of car / colour

		
	==> Generating cameras at certain GPS coordinates
	
			- Using OpenStreetMaps or GoogleMaps to determine the actual coordinates
			- Methods to write the data to a flat file

			
	==> Mathematics: 

			- Sides/diagonals inside a square, using vectors (distance and direction from point A to B)
			-Limiting to only UK.
			- Quadratic equations to simulate curves
		    	- Perhaps testing with sinus-functions


	==> Database: 
			-Presentation Layer - Business Layer - Data Layer
			-Drawn up in an XML.
